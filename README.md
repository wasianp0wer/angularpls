# angularpls README

In Angular v14 the option was added for standalone components, which would do away with modules in your project. However, Angular language service was not updated with it. Not cool!

Because of that, you would have to manually update your component with the import which is terrible. This extension fixes that problem by adding Intellisense suggestions for your components.

## Features

- Auto complete your component names
- Auto import components

## Running this project

For now, I'm not putting this on the extension store bc right now it is not good enough. To run it for now, open it in VScode, run NPM install, and then press F5 to start a VSCode window with this extension running. Pls let me know if you find any bugs! - Maddie
